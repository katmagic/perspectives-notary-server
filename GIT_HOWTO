You can use git-svn to work with our SVN repo on moo.  Here are some tips:

I think we checked out with something like: 

git svn clone https://moo.cmcl.cs.cmu.edu/svn/perspectives --trunk=trunk --branches=branches --tags=tags

Anyway, currently I have a 'master' branch and a 'git-svn' branch.  

'git svn fetch' pulls down the latest changes, and 'git merge git-svn' 
merges those into my 'master' branch.  I can then 'git add' and 'git commit'
to my heart's content, and then when i want to push, i do a 'git svn dcommit'.
