Updating the XPI: 

(Needed only to release official versions of perspectives)

Dependencies: openssl, unzip, and the following perl modules: 
Convert::ASN1, XML::Parser, RDF::Core

To generate the update.rdf we use
a gpl script found here.  http://www.softlights.net/projects/mexumgen/
1) Make sure you have necessary dependencies.
2) Update the version in the install.rdf and make the xpi as described above.
3) Get hold of the private key
4) sh genupdate.sh <private key> <perspectives.xpi>
5) put the xpi and the update.rdf on the web servers
