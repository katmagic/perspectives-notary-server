<h1>Perspectives Firewall/Proxy Help</h1>

<h3> What Protocol and Ports does Perspectives Use? </h3> 

<p> 
Perspectives uses the standard HTTP protocol to query network notary servers.
However, some of these notary servers are unable to listen on the standard
HTTP port (port 80) and instead listen on port 8080.  While most firewalls
and proxies should allow this traffic, some may not.  
You can contact your network administrator to find out whether 
Perspectives traffic is likely being dropped by a proxy or firewall.  
</p> 

<h3> If I cannot contact any notaries, is it safe to  manually override the 
browser security warning? </h3>
<p> 
NO.  When Perspectives is unable to reach the notary servers, 
it does not receive the data necessary 
to distinguish between a valid and an invalid certificate.  Accepting a
certificate  without notary validation can be dangerous, because it may be 
that an attacker is intentionally dropping your notary queries.
