<h1>Perspectives Firewall/Proxy Help</h1>

<h3> Why do firewalls and proxies cause Perspectives to fail? </h3> 

<p> 
Many corporate and university networks use firewalls or proxies to limit the set of protocols you are 
allowed to use on the Internet.  Since Perspectives is new and communicates over the "non-standard" 
UDP port 15217, many firewalls and proxies unintentionally drop the packets Perspectives sends to 
query the network notaries.  You can contact your network administrator to find out whether 
Perspectives traffic is likely being dropped by a proxy or firewall.  
</p> 

<h3> Does that mean it is safe to ignore this warning and manually override the security error? </h3>
<p> 
NO.  When Perspectives is unable to reach the notary servers, it does not receive the data necessary 
to distinguish between a valid and an invalid certificate.  In fact, just proceeding without notary 
validation is dangerous, because it may be the case that an attacker is intentionally dropping your 
notary queries.  
<p> 

<p> 
In the future, we are looking to add simple HTTP querying functionality to Perspectives servers to get 
around this issue. If you are interested in helping out, let us know.
