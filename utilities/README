This directory contains a lot of utilities that are useful for testing
notary code and converting from the old MySQL database format to the 
new Berkeley DB format.  A lot of the parameters are hardcoded for now,
so using them elsewhere without modifying the code will likely break.  

It can build the following targets:

simple_client :  a very simple notary client that queries a notary 
server for a single observation

load_test_client : takes files containing service-ids and does a bulk
query to a single notary server for all service-ids, measuring how 
long it takes to complete.

signature_util : runs through an entire notary database, either verifying
the signatures are correct, or calculating and then verifying all signatures.
Warning: calculating all signature can take a LONG time.  

db_search :  takes a regular expression and a db file and prints out
all entries in the db with keys that match the regex.  

update_timespans_test :  code that tests the code used by a notary to update
a database record based on a new observation.  

db_speed_test: A simple test to grab random service_ids and see how long
BDB takes to read them.
