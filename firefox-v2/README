To build the platform specific binaries follow the instructions in xp_src or
win_xp_src depending on the target platform.

To build an xpi simply type make.

To push an update follow these instructions.
Updating an extension is relatively simple.  We need to make an xpi, an
update.rdf file, and put those on the server.  To generate the update.rdf we use
a gpl script found here.  http://www.softlights.net/projects/mexumgen/
1) Make sure you have necessary dependencies.
  Dependencies include (but are not necessarily limited to) openssl unzip and
  the following perl modules: Convert::ASN1, XML::Parser, RDF::Core
2) Update the version in the install.rdf and make the xpi
3) Get hold of the private key
4) sh genupdate.sh <private key> <perspectives.xpi>
5) put the xpi and the update.rdf on the web servers
